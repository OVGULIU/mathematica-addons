INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Install the files in the addons package into a directory where
mathematica can find them.  For example, my mathematica installation
is in
   /usr/local/apps/mathematica/
so I put the files in
   /usr/local/apps/mathematica/AddOns/Applications

If you don't have root access, put them in another directory, such as
   $HOME/.Mathematica/Applications
then set the mathematica $Path variable so the kernel can find them
(in version 5.0, this directory will automatically be searched).
For example, to alert mathematica to the files in the directory
$HOME/share/math, put the following line in the
.Mathematica/Kernel/init.m file:
     $Path = Append[$Path, ToFileName[{$HomeDirectory, "share", "math"}]];

In the file init.m included with this distribution is a series of
DeclarePackage declarations which, if you wish, can also be put into
the .Mathematica/(VERSION)/Kernel/init.m file to autoload the packages.

ENJOY!
